            <h2>About Me</h2>
           
            <br>

            <p>My name is Dalia Bolton and I am a UX Designer.</p>
                
            <p> I love the art of designing for the experience of interacting with technology. Each platform has a way of creating an individual and personal experience if they choose, and I love the challenge of making that experience come to life. </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3 style="font-size: 25px;max-width: 90%;">To help illustrate who I am a bit better, here is "my story".</h3>
            <br>
            

                <p>I grew up in Berkeley, CA surrunded by friends and family, including my 3 brothers. I went to Berkeley High School - shout out - then to UC Santa Cruz - also shout out - where I majored in Sociology and Minored in Linguistics.</p>
            
            <p>Throughout my first 2 -3 years in college I was undeclared and confused. I pretty much took a class in every subject you could think of including Computer Science but realized my head wasn't in it at the time. However, taking CS classes led me to find Linguistics which still to this day makes me thrilled and excited. </p>
               <p> Linguistics is one of those middle subjects that help you recognize so much about who you are and the world. This included, the fact that I liked the technical aspect of understanding language and using it to problem solve. It also taught me that language is a very detailed and complex phenomenon, but can also be very simple and straightfoward. And, I loved it. </p>
       
            

        <p>This enabled me to dive into the tech world with my knowledge of problem solving and communication. I worked at a startup for a year full time and then some time after remotely. I moved to Austin, then pursued a passion of mine - digital art, which landed me on this page today. Coding my portfolio and telling you my story.</p>
<p>If you've made it this far, thank you. </p>
